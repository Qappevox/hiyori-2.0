# hiyori-2.0

This is a project that includes a voice AI bot named Hiyori. The project has two main parts, the front-end and the AI back-end.

# Front-end
<li>The front-end of the project is the user interface that users interact with. In this project, the front-end is created using Wallpaper Engine software. Wallpaper Engine is a software that allows users to use interactive and animated desktop wallpapers.</li>

<li>In Hiyori's front-end, an animated wallpaper is included that has interactive elements. The front-end also includes audio effects that correspond with user interactions.</li>

# AI Back-end
<li>The AI back-end of the project is responsible for processing user input and responding accordingly. In this project, the back-end is created using the Kivy framework, a Python-based GUI framework.</li>

<li>The back-end includes a small GUI where users can interact with Hiyori via voice commands. When a user speaks a command into their computer's microphone, the back-end processes the audio input and returns an appropriate response.</li>

<li>It is important to note that the back-end works independently of the front-end. This means that the AI can be used without the Wallpaper Engine software.</li>

# How to Use
To use Hiyori, follow the steps below:

<li>Install Wallpaper Engine software on your computer.</li>
<li>Download the Hiyori wallpaper from the project repository and apply it as your desktop wallpaper.</li>
<li>Navigate to the AI folder and run the Hiyori AI bot using the Kivy framework.</li>
<li>Interact with Hiyori by speaking to the bot using your computer's microphone.</li>
